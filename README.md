## Learning goals

At the end of the morning workshop, you will be able to:

- Organize your data, analysis, and results so that 'you in six months' can easily continue where you left off.
- Commit changes to a git repository and handle simple merges and pull requests
- Trust your colleagues code (without needing to trust your colleagues)
- Avoid common pitfalls when using LLMs
